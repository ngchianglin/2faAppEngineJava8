2 Factor Authentication Implementation for JSP/Servlet on Google App Engine Standard 

## Introduction

The repository contains a 2 factor authentication implementation using simple JSP/Servlet application. The 2nd Factor authentication relies on a time-based one time password generated by the Google Authenticator Mobile Application running on an Android phone. The entire source code can be imported into Eclipse IDE as a maven project, and then deployed to Google App Engine using the Google cloud tool for Eclipse. A simple automated end to end testing is implemented using Selenium Web Driver.
